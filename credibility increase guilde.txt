business website seven steps uh from beginning to  end comparing and contrasting world web web-based  
3:03
cloud builders and wordpress which is one of my  favorite tools to work in i've been working in  
3:09
wordpress since 2007 i've been designing websites  since 1997 so yeah i've been around the block  
3:17

3:48
okay now um yeah we are going to be talking about  websites tonight today i just launched the website  
3:57
how to build your own small business website it  compares in contrast website builders web you know  
4:03
cloud-based builders like wix weebly squarespace  and um wordpress my favorite pbr cheers
4:17
so kitty are you happy to  close out this long long week   i know we are just a few more days  just a few more days anyhow um
4:33
yeah so i was comparing and contrasting  the cloud-based web builders like
4:55
at shows do you know they actually bought weebly  i think it was last year or maybe the year before  
5:01
and now um i'm i'm pretty happy with that um  i know that well it's really interesting for  
5:08
many years when i had when i was using  yeah when i was using square up as my  
5:16
merchant accounts in my shop and it shows  i was having so much fun with it because it  
5:25
actually i don't know if i can show  you here now it almost felt like i was
5:35
working in a fast food menu when i would select  
5:42
when i would use it let's see if i can pull it  up so i can show you it was fantastic i love  
5:50
square up and i have been a die hard fan for many  many years and slowly it's coming up but are you  
5:59
coming up now i'll keep talking as it comes out  ah there we go um no session expired never mind
6:11
anyhow um it felt like it was a fast food menu it  had a number of different icons on there that had  
6:19
all that was featuring all of my products and  when the customer selected her product i could  
6:25
go ahead and send her a receipt and the actual  product image if i had it embedded in my inventory  
6:32
would show up on her receipt which i absolutely  loved and then later on what i slowly discovered  
6:41
probably quicker than most but i was really happy  to see that square up had taken my inventory and  
6:47
swept it up into a website and it's free it's a  free website now they have a paid website which is  
6:57
built on the weebly foundation but you know  that allows you to go ahead and tweak it a  
7:04
little bit more and optimize it the way you want  to but yeah if you have your inventory already  
7:13
embedded into the square up device and that app  it will just go ahead and sweep it up and then  
7:20
what i've done for clients is i have taken those  elements and popped them back into their website  
7:25
to showcase any way they want so yeah that's  a nice efficient uh bootstrappers way of  
7:33
building your business without uh  without you know being too costly so  
7:40
i'm gonna have another sip and uh welcome  kitty yeah it's 10 years long too long
7:53
i'm glad you guys can hear me that's great oh okay  
8:00
so let's talk about boosting  your website credibility
8:09
yeah that's right andrew square did make  everything in the shop so much easier  
8:15
and if you had a number of limited  production runs you know so we would  
8:21
uh build maybe small batches of purses  or accessories or things like that  
8:27
we could manage an inventory so if andrew was  on one side of the shop and i was at the other  
8:33
or we were in booths and he sold one thing it  would update the inventory immediately so i was  
8:40
i was very i was very surprised very delighted  that square had that kind of system built  
8:48
relatively inexpensively for you  know small businesses like myself  
8:55
so yeah so the website uh video that i uploaded  today how to build your own small business website  
9:05
it compares all of those not all of them wix  weebly squarespace on a very high level um  
9:14
so that you can determine depending on what  your focus and your goal is for your website  
9:20
i kind of outlined what each of them are pretty  excuse me pretty quickly um so that way you can  
9:26
just dive in and go okay well she suggested square  space for me or she just she suggested weebly and  
9:33
square up for me let me go check those out first  because i just want to make your time as efficient   as possible if you're going to use any of those  platforms and then of course those platforms  
9:45
um i threw in a few caveats which  unfortunately from a small business builder  
9:54
aspect is if you decide to go with one of those  cloud-based web builder platforms like wix weebly  
10:00
squarespace not square up squarespace  so let me backtrack wix or squarespace
10:09
it makes it super difficult impossible actually  to migrate any of that content that you've built  
10:16
if you want to use square up or  wordpress so just to let you know  
10:23
those are some of the things that  you'll run into in the event that   you ultimately decide you want to switch over into  the wordpress platform so another drink for me
10:40
so if you are here in the chat with us welcome  my name is lisa stewart and i help steam  
10:45
entrepreneurs build their business from the ground  up if you want to build products that sell connect  
10:51
with your customers and grow your community make  sure that you subscribe to my youtube channel and  
10:57
click that notification bell so that when i do  go live or when i do premiere my videos you'll   get notified of it and that's that's what that  little bell is for if ever you were wondering that  
11:08
little bell will let you know as soon as you pop  on youtube or if you've got your notifications on  
11:14
on your phone or any other smart device it  will just pop up and say lisa stewart has   gone live or build your own small business  with lisa stewart is now live so make sure  
11:24
you've got that that paint no whack it like  a kitten so boosting your website credibility  
11:34
there are a couple of ways that you can do that  the first one is you want to make it easy to   verify the accuracy of the information  on your site so if you are providing  
11:46
any third-party support like citations  references or any source material make sure  
11:52
that you've got links to that so that way your  customers have confidence in choosing you as  
11:59
your service provider or to purchase products from  you so yeah make it easy to verify that accuracy  
12:08
and another thing that i discover for many small  business owners is they hide behind their website  
12:15
they don't share who they are um and why  they started the site or why they started  
12:20
their business and i have to say not doing that  is a huge discredit to you i don't want that for  
12:30
you because we have been dealing with amazon the  big box stores right and we've been dealing with  
12:38
offshoring there are a lot of people who prefer  to work and purchase local and local means either  
12:45
hyper local if you are looking for you know  food from a restaurant or you know donuts or  
12:53
you want to do any shopping locally you want to  be able to understand who is behind that website  
13:00
and the crazy thing is people love to know  who the designer is who the chef is who  
13:07
the product developer is because they want to  talk to you people feel special when they get  
13:12
access to talk to you as the creator so put your  face up there even if it's on the about us page  
13:21
start there because that way people can you know  attach a name with a face and go oh yeah lisa yeah  
13:29
i saw her walking down the street or i saw her  in her shop i can't believe that she's always   there i thought that she would hire a minion to  you know man the shop for her things like that  
13:39
people also want to be able to you know talk with  you on the phone and they want to see your face  
13:47
hear your voice so i would recommend also doing  video that way people start to form an attachment  
13:54
with your mannerisms and your idiosyncrasies so  make sure there is real people behind your website  
14:04
this also includes listing a physical address  and i know some of you don't want to list your  
14:11
physical address especially if you work from  home i get it so what i'd recommend as a p.o  
14:17
box and that's fine a p.o box is fine um it shows  that you actually live either in your hometown or  
14:27
in your state or in the these united states of  america or wherever you are in your country they  
14:33
want to know you know if you live in france  you know if you talk about living in france   do you have a website you know do you  have a physical address in your home  
14:42
country so you know make sure that people  can start making correlations and understand  
14:49
who you are and where you're from because  they want to know let's see what else if you  
14:57
actually work out of the home if you are  renting space right in an office building  
15:04
or in a retail space or an incubator show  the photo of your store or your office front  
15:12
people want to know people want to see that  physical location so make it easy for them
15:19
how about you guys what do you think
15:25
are you feeling okay about putting  your face on your website does that  
15:30
make you queasy let me know  in the chat i'd like to know
15:37
okay now point number three highlight  the expertise in your organization and  
15:44
the content that you provide so if you're a  product developer i want to see your products  
15:50
and i know that a lot of creators sometimes  have a gallery page and then if they have  
15:57
products to sell they don't necessarily indicate  to anybody that they do so if you've got a shop  
16:03
outside your own website right if you've got  a shop on another commerce platform like itsy  
16:09
or amazon or any of them please let people know  that a lot of creators kind of miss that point  
16:17
sometimes they go oh i have a gallery and i  have you know sold paintings or sold products  
16:24
but if i'm a consumer and i i look at your site  and i go oh that's really interesting i wonder  
16:30
if she's got any more of these or when did she  build this i want to know and i want to know if   you have any more so let me know even if it's just  text right even if you don't have the ability to  
16:41
link your your product pages or your sales  pages from itsy or any of those stores right  
16:48
now just say you know more for sale here on my  website so just make it easy make it easy for us
16:58
and andrew that's exactly right it  is dependent on what you are selling   and offering that's absolutely true
17:06
so oh
17:12
next tip that's right andrew it's always important  to let people know where you are  
17:22
you know what i haven't done tonight i haven't  checked to see what kind of time delay we're on  
17:27
i'm going to do that right now because sometimes  it's 10 seconds sometimes it's 20 seconds  
17:32
so i'm gonna start now one one thousand two one  thousand three one thousand four one thousand  
17:39
five one thousand six one thousand seven one  thousand eight one thousand nine one thousand   ten one thousand eleven one thousand twelve  one thousand thirteen one thousand fourteen one  
17:49
thousand fifteen one thousand sixteen one thousand  seventeen one thousand eighteen one thousand  
17:54
nineteen one thousand twenty one thousand twenty  twenty second delay so there we are good to know
18:04
i'm going to take another sip  so all of you can catch up
18:20
okay so diving deeper into standing behind your  brand and making you and showing that there's life  
18:34
behind your website is also showcasing your team  and your hobbies so for instance if it's just you  
18:43
let people know that you have a life um i kind  of like let my life go when i had my my shop  
18:50
it was um it was pretty demanding and  pretty time consuming i absolutely  
18:57
i absolutely um loved building the  products and discovered that suddenly um  
19:06
i had no downtime and i didn't have any hobbies  i had integrated all of my hobbies as marketing  
19:14
tools so that way i knew what i was doing my  business so from photography product development
19:21
product showcasing and product photography you  know understanding light understanding how to  
19:27
photograph it you know on a white space  learning how to photograph it on people  
19:32
and things like that so yeah i just took all those  hobbies and swept them up into marketing tools  
19:40
kitty that's pretty funny i should probably do  that use the his name is fat cat so fat cat is  
19:48
the guide to everything throughout the website and  my courses and my ebooks so yeah you will find fat  
19:58
cat dressed up in all kinds of apparel he's even  featured as lady godiva riding bareback on a horse
20:08
i thought you might like that but yeah um showcase your your  hobbies um your side um your life  
20:19
right outside of your business so that  people can get to know you people can get   to know what it is you love to do do you love  wine versus beer do you love cats versus dogs  
20:30
do you like to go hiking do you like steampunk  like i do you know things like that people  
20:35
want to know what makes you unique so yeah  definitely okay i'm taking another drink now
20:47
how are you guys doing are  you on to your second glass  
20:53
if there's anyone else here watching the video  let me know i would love to know if you're here  
20:58
and if you are enjoying this content on  tips to boost your website credibility
21:08
fat cat godiva yeah i would love to animate  him because he's got long flowing hair  
21:19
that covers up his naughty bits so  yeah there's some irreverence in there
21:26
okay so the next tip that i want to share to  boost your website credibility is make it easy to  
21:35
contact you um make sure that your phone number is  on there make sure your um your email is on there  
21:44
and maybe a contact form and you can have all of  these or some of these you can have them all in  
21:51
one place or you can have them peppered throughout  but what i would recommend is having your  
21:57
phone number at the top of your page i have it on  the top of my page so that way people can easily  
22:06
text me or leave me a voicemail because  because what i do is i screen all of my calls  
22:15
um these bots are in they are relentless and they  are incessantly incessantly annoying aren't they
22:28
oh andrew i think i'm going to cut you off  slowly working through your frost class
22:37
kitty that's great cracking  open a second beer cheers girl
22:46
but yeah when i have when i go through websites  if i'm a consumer the first thing i look for is  
22:52
how easily can i contact you you know is there  a phone number is there a name is there an email  
23:01
address or is there a form and if there's none of  that uh it seems pretty dubious to me i don't care  
23:07
how clean and well designed your website is if  you don't have any of that information up there  
23:14
i'm not doing business with you because if i have  questions about your product or service or if i  
23:20
have questions about your return policy and i  can't reach you i'm walking away walking away  
23:32
so how about you guys have you  come across any websites without   that contact information let me know
23:47
that's forced oh that's great all right
24:07
another thing about boosting your website  credibility is making it simple back in  
24:14
the beginning when flash was a thing and i can't  believe that flash is still a thing i thought that  
24:22
um macromedia built flash and then i believe  adobe bought it excuse me i need some water
24:38
and then adobe killed it but for  whatever reason it is still alive
24:51
yeah andrew that's that's true don't make it  difficult for your customer to hunt for your  
24:58
contact information make it super simple and make  navigating your website super simple because if  
25:08
people have to hunt and pack to find certain  things they're gonna walk away they're gonna  
25:14
you know jump off and go find your competitor  and buy from them so if you can resist it all  
25:23
don't use flash html html has upgraded  the last couple of years to html5 making  
25:34
interactive videos like flash used to be easier  and more lightweight for everyone's website so
25:44
definitely um try to eliminate flash from your  website pronto i know that i don't know if you  
25:55
guys know this but yeah um andrew i i actually  thought they killed it a lot a lot longer um but
26:05
i belong to toastmasters and the toastmasters   website was built on flash  and they built a new online um
26:19
i'm trying to think of the word for it the  terminology goal setting so if you have ever  
26:25
been involved in toastmasters when i enrolled  a few years ago they gave me a couple of books  
26:32
one was the competent communicator book  and the other one was on leadership and  
26:39
each each of them if you've ever taken piano  lessons when you were a kid and the books that  
26:45
you would get would have lesson by lesson well  this is what toastmasters had it was speech by  
26:51
speech and so i think they had uh don't quote  me on this i'll say 10 speeches in each book  
26:57
and they would create these structures on how to  present your speech which i wish i had known i  
27:04
would have joined toastmasters a long time ago  had i known how to structure a speech because  
27:09
as designers we weren't taught that we were  taught to design you know learn how to compose  
27:14
right our our design and our graphic communication  but never did we never were we taught how to  
27:24
present our materials and so this we had to learn  on our own so if there are any designers out there  
27:30
any budding business owners watching this right  now and you are deathly afraid of public speaking  
27:37
i would recommend toastmasters because  it is a very well structured program each  
27:46
session it's a weekly session is 70 or  75 minutes i can never remember because  
27:52
there's some networking involved and so forth  but it is a well choreographed well-structured  
27:58
meeting and there are tiny little tasks  that many people can participate in  
28:06
so the toastmaster is the mc for the day  and they get up and they present the other  
28:16
tasks that are performed so they will they will  call upon the grammarian and so one person who  
28:22
has volunteered for that position will come  up and and cite the word of the day and then   they'll also share with them share with the rest  of the group what their task is and that would  
28:33
include looking for grammatical errors looking for  fillers like um's oz and so's which i am guilty of  
28:41
and i am trying to eliminate that as fast  as possible some days is better than others
28:50
they will also call upon the timekeeper and the  timekeeper will then um actually just keep time  
28:59
he won't evaluate but he'll keep time on how  long each person presents the uh grammarian  
29:07
or the humorist or any speeches that are being  taken place that day we also have table topics  
29:14
table topics are a lot of fun table topics are if  we have enough time during the session they will  
29:22
the table topics master will come up and throw  out questions to the group sometimes if they are
29:34
sometimes if table topics masters are sadistic  they will just call people up and then ask them  
29:39
a question but as the introvert the card-carrying  introvert that i am i will throw out a question  
29:47
to the group and then i will let people put up  their hand and answer it because introverts are  
29:54
on like a five second delay like you know um like  like me on like me on live right now the brains  
30:02
take a moment to reset and think about all the  options that they have when it comes to answering  
30:09
that particular question and that depending  on whether or not the table topics master  
30:14
is good at providing context because sometimes  then the introvert brain is like okay well what  
30:21
perspective is the table topics master coming from  oh i could ask him hey you know could you explain  
30:27
more about the context of the question so and the  questions are really simple you know they could be  
30:33
hey you know how do you um how was your how was  your holiday weekend or what plans do you have  
30:41
for vacation this year um really simple questions  but your answer has to be effective and it has to  
30:48
be spoken within 90 seconds and so you have  to get the gears together so that you aren't  
30:57
flo mixed and muddled going through trying  to explain exactly what it is you plan for  
31:03
vacation time so yeah and that really helps  introverts like me speak off the cough and that  
31:10
is primarily why i joined joined toastmasters  but anyhow um yeah if you are deathly afraid of  
31:20
speaking and presenting to clients  toastmasters is a great way to do that  
31:26
i also use toastmasters for many of my  presentations so if ever i've got a new  
31:33
presentation coming up that's a business minded  presentation i'll put it together and i'll run it  
31:39
by the folks at the toastmasters meeting and get  their feedback and it's immediate and i absolutely  
31:46
love it so yeah toastmasters is a fantastic  group to join and it's inexpensive too it's  
31:54
i think 89 every six months and they meet weekly  so you can always get feedback on any speeches  
32:01
and presentations that you want to make for your  clients or you want to make on the stage for your  
32:06
business so yeah i would absolutely recommend that  oh kitty thank you yeah they killed it december  
32:16
31st and as of january 12th block flash content  from running that's great that's really good news
32:34
okay so how about you kitty have  you ever joined toastmasters i know   andrew you were in it for a little while with me
32:44
anybody else here on the chat watching  and thinking about um joining toastmasters  
32:54
thinking about public speaking and how  it's uh it's a white knuckle experience
33:03
yeah kitty are you a fellow introvert yeah  i need a second too i can't just you know  
33:10
roll right into it these lives as a matter  of fact they're not scripted but they are  
33:18
i've got bullet points because otherwise i'll go  off the rails i'll yard sale and keep talking and  
33:23
talking and talking and not bring myself back  so yeah that's why it's really great to have   you guys here on the chat as well so it keeps  me on task and i can know what you're thinking  
33:39
huh okay kitty if ever you are interested in  toastmasters the interesting thing about the  
33:47
pandemic is that we are conducting  our sessions via zoom which means  
33:54
you can test out any toastmasters group  from your own desk from your own laptop  
34:03
i have yet to do it which i would love to do i  haven't had a chance to do it i really haven't  
34:08
planned but i should do it now rather than later  because if things start to open up and we start  
34:14
meeting in person i will be able to maybe join a  toastmasters meeting in scotland or in japan or  
34:23
kansas city you know um they're open up to  visitors just popping in and saying hello and  
34:31
participating in their in their sessions and if  they have a spot opened up for speaking usually  
34:39
there are three spots that are opened up you  can give a speech there too so if you've got  
34:46
a speech that you've given at a local toastmasters  group they gave you feedback and you were able to  
34:53
make those tweaks and you want to give it again  at a different toastmasters group you can do that  
34:59
so i love being able to iterate as quickly  as possible to make sure that i'm getting  
35:04
things right and they're succinct and they're  efficient so that's a nice way to test your ideas
35:19
infp right here right here absolutely cheers okay another tip to boost your website  credibility is to update your site's content at  
35:39
least show that it's been updated recently and  the best way to do that is through your blog  
35:48
if you have a website you've got a blog attached  then the blog brings life to your website  
35:55
the the blog page is really a post if  you're doing it on something like wordpress  
36:02
so the cms content management system and what  wordpress does what wordpress started out a  
36:11
long time ago was a content management system  it was just basic blogging that's all it was and  
36:16
of course when i found it i'm like oh can i turn  this into my website and it was really difficult  
36:23
back in the beginning to create pages they didn't  have pages and pages are static pages that just  
36:32
sit there as a basic page that you could put you  know the about me on you could put a product on  
36:41
you could create a landing page for a variety  of products and they didn't have that now they  
36:46
do and now so many different businesses  are on wordpress running on wordpress  
36:55
so i was super happy about that and what  the blog does for your website now is it  
37:04
pings google and google says oh hey this website's  been updated and it brings your website if you're  
37:11
using the correct keywords attached to your blog  posts as well as your pages make sure that you  
37:20
update the pages as well and they will get moved  up into the google search ranking like i said make  
37:27
sure that you're using the correct keywords  so that you are being shown as a result when  
37:34
your potential customers are looking for you so i  that's why i love the cms system so very very much
37:45
okay another drink here
37:52
oh good question kitty have you done any chats  talking about video editing for your content  
37:58
you want to upload oh so much to unpack  there so much to unpack okay um that is  
38:08
in the works that's my plan because right now  what i've got is i've got a course called byo  
38:15
build your own money message and what that does  is that's a foundation for your brand and what  
38:22
i'm going to attach to that is video content  specifically how to create an intro video  
38:32
for your website does that sound like something  you that you'd be interested in let me know  
38:37
and then beyond that there are a variety of  different videos that you can create for your  
38:45
service or products and they are anything from  explainer videos how to videos skill based videos  
38:58
how to wear my product videos there are there  are an assortment there's probably like seven  
39:04
different videos that you could create for  for your for your business and if you are shy  
39:12
like me you can do um faceless videos you can do  explainer videos you can do how-to videos you can  
39:22
do how to wear my product how to use my product  without ever showing your face so let me know  
39:30
in the chat kitty specifically what you are  looking for because yeah that's in the works  
39:37
and i want to make sure that um  anything any any content that i create  
39:45
will benefit you so i don't want to be over  here developing something when really you needed  
39:50
something over here so let me know  specifically what you're looking for
39:58
you talked about video editing  so are you talking specifically   on the desktop as you're doing post  production or are you talking about  
40:08
building a video and you know what the  end result is what the transformation  
40:13
is at the end of that for your customer let  me know specifically what you're talking about
40:34
if you're just joining us hi i'm lisa stewart  and i help steam entrepreneur steam entrepreneurs  
40:40
build their business from the ground up and today  we are talking about websites and right now we're  
40:49
going through the list of the best ways to boost  your website credibility and how we can get you to  
40:59
implement that right away on your own website  sandy hey welcome girl what's in your glass
41:15
yay yup sandy's in the house talk amongst  yourselves kitty so you're saying that you are  
41:36
addicted to several costume people so are those  the cosplayers talk about video editing being time  
41:42
consuming yes it's extremely time consuming and  you wouldn't have the faintest idea where to start  
41:50
okay so depending on what your your os is  kitty are you pc or are you mac because  
41:59
you can start with a couple of free tools  to do that all right wine welcome sandy um  
42:08
i haven't mentioned this but we are haven't  mentioned it recently we are drinking 19 crimes
42:18
right here the 2018 shiraz and it's pretty darn  good tonight i'm really happy with it it's smooth  
42:27
and uh it's hitting the gutters nicely it's  got a nice aroma ah okay so kitty you're on pc  
42:34
um let me investigate there are a  couple of free tools that you can use   i don't want to launch you into something that  could be overwhelming you can also do video  
42:46
editing on your phone do you have an android are  you pc based phone or do you have the apple phone  
42:54
i know there are a number of apps  in the app store that you can  
43:01
um that you can download and  actually edit movies on your phone
43:11
yeah sandy the wine label is great it's also an  augmented reality wine label i was demonstrating  
43:19
it the other day to a friend and um i compared  that to the rabble wine that i was playing with  
43:28
last year and the rabble wine augmented reality  label was so much fun the wine label was a  
43:41
picture it looked like an old like 15th century  illustration of an old european town with clouds  
43:48
hovering over it and they were the clouds were  shooting lightning and meteors and things like  
44:00
that to the town and then you could hear it  rumble and explode and then you it was it got  
44:06
pretty dark because then you could hear people  screaming so it was pretty gassy but pretty fun
44:17
this particular wine label 19 crimes is this this  i know that 19 crimes has a series of labels this  
44:24
is the only one that i've tested it's not as fun  uh the convict pops up and talks a little bit like  
44:33
maybe five seconds and then disappears so it's not  quite as dark and charming as the rabble wine was
44:45
oh yeah andrew that's right um davinci is  available but i would not recommend anybody  
44:56
who is just starting out to download  that i don't want to overwhelm them  
45:02
kitty yeah you used to hard code html back  in the early 2000s i did that back in the  
45:07
in the 90s yeah i coded my first website after  i built my own pc i coded my own website and uh  
45:17
it's still a decent looking website i've got  it somewhere i will have to bring that up and   maybe show some well if it's html  it would still work so uh yeah um
45:29
hand coding you know that's the way to go  in the very beginning so you know exactly   what you're getting um but as far as video  editing on the pc let me go do some research  
45:40
i've needed to do that anyway and so that's  that's in the list of things to do so that  
45:46
way when i do talk about video editing i can  talk both pc and os um i know that in the mac  
45:55
the mac gave us imovie and i cut my teeth on  that for several years and it wasn't until  
46:05
last summer that i decided to get serious with  using davinci resolve and davinci resolve is  
46:11
quite the little editor and it is both for  pc and for mac i absolutely love it and  
46:20
there are a ton of youtubers out there who show  you how to use davinci and what i can do is i can  
46:26
send you a link you could just go to youtube  and check out some of the channels that i've  
46:32
bookmarked i'm happy to send those to you and just  get familiar with the interface because if you're  
46:38
a hard coder like i am you might be able to work  in davinci um and i don't say that lightly because  
46:50
a lot of people who weren't coders like andrew for  instance wasn't a coder so i coached him working  
46:56
through imovie and then imovie just didn't do  some things that we wanted to do but it did enough  
47:03
and then we're like okay you know what i think  it's time to dive into da vinci and uh there's a  
47:09
little bit of a learning curve but thank buddha  for youtube thank buddha for how tube because  
47:16
that's what it is that's a place for how how to  do things so yeah cheers to heart hard coding
47:29
i'd be happy to do that i will send those to  you and a list of youtubers that i i follow  
47:35
i've got a list of notes so if i if i'm on a  pickle and i need to figure out how to adjust  
47:43
my voice and i can normalize my track because  sometimes my voice comes in too loud too soft  
47:50
right now i'm having challenges with my audio  i'm not sure why my audio i'm using a shotgun mic  
47:57
and for whatever reason anytime i stop and  start my pre-recorded videos the shotgun mic  
48:05
comes in really loud and really tinny and so  i've got to go back and and fix that and in post  
48:10
production i need to go find a user group and  go guys what's going on with my audio because  
48:17
it's it's kind of nuts so i apologize for the last   video it was really apparent in the last  video the video that i uploaded today
48:26
but anyway so today sandy we are talking about  how to boost your credibility on your website  
48:35
all right now let's see um i'm getting  near the end um the penultimate point i  
48:43
want to make is to restrain any promotional  material that you put on your website i  
48:51
what i mean by that is some people like to use  google adwords and pop that in their website   so they can make additional pennies off the  website but for me i feel like that separates the  
49:05
noobs from the folks who really want to make  a go at um positioning their websites as the  
49:15
the premiere or position their products as  the premiere product that people want to buy  
49:21
adding google words onto your website tends  to clutter and also in my opinion it tends to  
49:30
de-emphasize the professionalism that you want to  exude so i would not put on those google adwords  
49:38
on your website at all you want your product first  and foremost on your website that's what you want  
49:45
because otherwise what happens is if you've  got so many bells and whistles on your website  
49:51
people tend to go oh look um that particular  sweater from that site is now following on to  
49:58
your site and that's not what you want because  then suddenly they might say you know what i   think i'll go buy that sweater oops sorry you  know i didn't know that you're trying to sell me  
50:06
you know your product but bye bye i'm off you know  chasing the squirrel that's not what you want so  
50:14
my opinion please don't put ads on your website
50:21
and then the last point i want to make  is make sure that you do spell check  
50:28
on your website it happens to the best of us   but do spell check and what i normally  do is i use grammarly and i run through  
50:41
all of my all of my content through grammarly i  have a number of different documents in grammarly  
50:49
i also run my video um script through grammarly  to make sure that everything is in order now  
51:00
when i'm running my video script through  grammarly i don't necessarily check for spell   spell check because i'm not worried about it  at that point but when i do go back into closed  
51:12
captions i will make sure that everything  i go back through grammarly and remove  
51:18
a lot of different notes and things like that  i had in there so that they don't show up in my   closed captions but i would recommend sending all  of your content especially if you're a solopreneur  
51:31
run all of your content through  grammarly so that you can make sure that  
51:37
your sentence structure is on  par your spelling is on par  
51:43
things that you meant to say the  way you mean to say them is on par   because otherwise people start looking at you  going hmm and they start i do this this is awful  
51:54
i start counting mistakes that i see especially  visual mistakes if people are putting their words  
52:01
up in text graphics and so forth and i know  a lot of people are using virtual assistants  
52:07
to help them do post-production in their  websites and their their videos as well  
52:15
but sometimes you've got to do a double triple  check to make sure that that spelling is correct  
52:20
because it's there in perpetuity it's there for  ever and i don't want you to look unprofessional  
52:29
when you are trying to put this together  so grammarly is a really good check for me  
52:34
there are sometimes i try to get andrew to step  in and listen to me speak on a couple of different  
52:42
points that i'm trying to make when it comes  to video content just to get him as a second  
52:48
ear to listen to me and make sure that i'm saying  something correctly or my emphasis is on point so  
52:56
you know if you've got a second person that can  do that for you that's great if not grammarly  
53:02
grammarly is my crotch grammarly is my  [ __ ] i use it every day all day long
53:13
ooh yeah sorry about that  kitty that sounds painful
53:20
well you can always do version two and  you can also publish an errata sheet  
53:25
to go along with that you know what an errata  sheet is an errata sheet if you don't know  
53:32
is something that i learned in the software  industry when i was working for software companies   back um back in the 90s and early 2000s an errata  sheet is basically a megalpa you know it says hey  
53:45
we found a mistake on page 99 here is the  correct you know either system or process  
53:53
or word that we meant to use and in  many cases back when we were still  
53:59
doing print books we would pop it in  the front cover of the book so that way  
54:04
when the user got the software manual they  would open it up and they would see the   errata sheet and go oh look okay they've  corrected their mistakes i get it because  
54:13
you know you can't correct print so unless of  course you take a a sharpie or a label across it
54:22
oh that's great okay good yeah and then also  um maybe um a pdf you know for those who have  
54:31
who have uh purchased your book um maybe as  a free download to them maybe it is a pdf  
54:39
or maybe a pdf sheet or something like  that might be helpful too so good okay  
54:46
not to mention if upgrading to different versions  which means you could upgrade your photos in that  
54:52
as well or your processes or maybe clarify  something um people love new versions so  
54:59
you can get repeat buyers that way so that's not  necessarily a bad thing cheers to repeat buyers
55:10
oh and kitty i didn't know  that you had knitting books
55:16
so sandy and i were just talking about taking  up knitting my mother-in-law taught me how to  
55:22
knit many years ago and i have since fallen away  from knitting but um i am thinking about picking  
55:30
it up again because as i mentioned earlier when  i had the shop my hobbies fell to the wayside  
55:37
and i thought you know i should really pick up  another hobby well i picked up knitting so that   i could knit and i could felt and use that in my  products but it has been several years so i would  
55:49
love to know um do you have a website and i want  access to your knitting books because sandy and i  
55:55
are gonna start our first project right sandy  and it's gonna be knitting the [ __ ] hat   i know it's four years later but still i want to  knit my own [ __ ] hat and i want to knit it in  
56:06
the the tone of pink that i want because i don't  do pepto-bismol pink and i don't do baby pink i do  
56:12
more darker pink so mine probably will be fuchsia  or you know a coloration variation thereof so  
56:20
yeah um isn't that right sandy let me know in the  chat are you uh going to knit a [ __ ] hat with me  
56:28
we can do a an uh bitchin knit  zoom session together yeah girl
56:38
okay there it is
56:48
all right kitty so kitty if you're interested in  building a website let me know i would be happy  
56:56
to reciprocate anyhow it is almost an hour  wow wow i can't believe i lasted that long  
57:06
how about you guys thanks for sticking around i  appreciate it i appreciate it okay so one thing  
57:13
i didn't do last week that i'm going to start  doing is grading creating my wines and i actually  
57:21
created a little grading sheet which i don't  think i have up here i need to put on my glasses
57:32
i had created a
57:38
a wine sheet um maybe i didn't export it  that's okay oh well i didn't export it
57:53
yeah that hour did go totally fast  didn't it whoops i meant andrew's uh  
58:01
andrew popped in pretty fast yeah that did go pretty fast um so  i'm delighted to hear that because  
58:10
as uh i i loved the idea of here i am going off  on a tangent in one of the harry potter movies  
58:18
where slughorn had the hourglass and the  hourglass went as fast or as slow as interesting  
58:28
as the conversation that evening i absolutely  love that concept i think that is fantastic  
58:34
so i would love one of those so if  ever i'm in a boring conversation   especially with me that hourglass slips away and  i'm like okay i'm done with that conversation with  
58:45
myself so what do you guys think do you guys like  that concept i know i do okay now let me wrap up  
58:53
with the grating of the wine so the color of the  wine is a nice dark brandy color not brandy um
59:08
um it's a nice dark plum color the  legs on it were pretty decent um  
59:15
i have now smudged it with all of my fingerprints  so i can't really see the legs on this anymore
59:22
no kitty it wasn't the time turner although  i would love to have one of those too   no this was in half blood prince  where slughorn had the party  
59:33
and they were they were going through the the  teens were going through you know teen sexual  
59:41
angst and all of that and slughorn would host his  dinner parties with the large ice cream in those  
59:49
big goldfish bowls ice cream for a family of  five for one person and when harry was hanging  
59:57
out after all the kids had left and departed  the dinner party he was talking to slughorn  
1:00:03
and slughorn had tinged his hourglass that was a  giant hourglass and had mentioned that the well  
1:00:13
i'm i'm watching the yeah sorry squirrel i'm  i'm watching off to the side the youtube live  
1:00:22
live ah i'm gonna have to cut this  shirt lu youtube live streaming and  
1:00:28
i think the delay got shorter so i'm  wondering if it was the bandwidth   anyhow um so yeah it was a really neat  hourglass and i would love one of those  
1:00:41
on to finishing the review of this wine so it was  smooth as soon as it touched my lips and my tongue  
1:00:49
and it stayed smooth the entire time it's got  a nice aftertaste and yeah i would recommend  
1:00:56
this wine i would bring this wine to a party  and i would recommend this wine for anyone so  
1:01:03
i'm really curious to taste this along with the  curry that andrew is going to make tonight so
